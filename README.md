# Multi-language Development Environment Container (Based on mise + Docker)

## Introduction
This container is based on Ubuntu and integrates [mise](https://github.com/jdx/mise) as a multi-language version management tool. It supports dynamic initialization of development environments for Node.js, Python, Go, etc., via the ENV_LANGS environment variable. All configuration is global (**not in the project directory**), and all shells/consoles can use the development tools directly.

## Usage

### 1. Build the image
```sh
docker build -t dev-env .
```

### 2. Run the container and specify the required language environments
For example: Enable Node.js lts, Python 3.13, and Go 1.24 at the same time
```sh
docker run -it \
  -e ENV_LANGS="node@lts python@3.13 go@1.24" \
  dev-env
```

### 3. After entering the container
All development tools are globally available, and you can use them directly in any shell/console:
```sh
node -v
python --version
go version
```

## Notes
- The global mise config file is located at `/etc/mise/mise.toml` and is automatically generated by entrypoint.sh according to ENV_LANGS.
- All development tools are installed globally via mise and are available in all shells.
- You can extend the supported languages in ENV_LANGS as needed.
